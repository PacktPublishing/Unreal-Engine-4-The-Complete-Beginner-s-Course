1.) .wav
2.) Sound Cue
3.) Ambient Sound Actor
4.) The quality of that sound will increase at a cost of increasing the amount of memory required for the sound.
5.) When you spawn a sound, you have control over it. You can choose to stop playing the sound at any point, or modify its properties. But when you play a sound, you don’t have any control over it. You can’t modify or stop it.
6.) Doppler effect
7.) Modulator Node
8.) attenuation
9.) At any point within the inner shape, the sound will be heard at 100% volume. In the outer shape, the sound will decrease in volume as it gets closer to the outer edge.
10.) mono
11.) Audacity
