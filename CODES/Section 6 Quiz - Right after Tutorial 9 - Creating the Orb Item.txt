1.) If two Actors are set to Block one another’s type, and the Simulation Generates Hit Events property is True for Actor 1 and False for Actor 2, when they collide, will Actor 1 register a Hit Event?

2.) If two Actors are set to Overlap one another’s type, and the Generate Overlap Events property is True for Actor 1 and False for Actor 2, when they overlap, will Actor 1 register an Overlap Event?

3.) What do Query Collisions and Physics Collisions refer to?

4.) If an Actor doesn’t move, what should you set its Object Type to?

5.) What should you set the Trace Responses to for a Static Mesh Actor meant to represent a transparent glass wall?

6.) What does an Apply Damage Node do?

7.) In a general sense, what is the strategy to prevent an Actor from registering too many Damage Events when colliding with something the applies damage to it?

1.) Yes. For an Actor’s Hit Event to fire, only the Simulation Generates Hit Events property for that Actor needs to be True.
2.) No. For an Actor’s Overlap Event to fire, both the Actors involved must have their Generate Overlap Events property set to True.
3.) Query Collisions refer to overlap collisions and Physics Collisions refer to blocking collisions.
4.) WorldStatic
5.) Overlap. This means other Actors will be able to register that the wall is there and also be able to detect Actors that are behind the wall.
6.) An Apply Damage Node will activate a Damage Event for the Actor connected to its Damaged Actor pin. It will also pass the data from its other pins to the Damage Event.
7.) Make that Actor temporarily immune to damage for a short time after each Damage Event.
